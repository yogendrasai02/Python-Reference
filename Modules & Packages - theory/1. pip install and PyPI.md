# `pip install` and PyPI

- **PyPI** is a repository for opensource 3rd party Python packages.
  - It is similar to NPM for Node.js, Packagist for PHP, CPAN for Perl, RubyGems for Ruby.

- To install these packages, use the following command in the command line: `pip install package_name`

- Sometimes, the firewall or anti virus may block internet access to `pip` in a company, so talk to the network administrator in that case.

- To import the packages or specific functions, use the following syntax:
  - `import package_name` imports all the methods available inside the package `package_name` which can be referenced using `package_name.method_name()` syntax.
  - `from package_name import method_1, method_2` imports the specific methods, which can be references using `method_1()` syntax.
  - `from package_name import *` imports all the methods under this package.

- While searching for packages:
  - Do a simple google search to search for the package.
  - Prefer using the official documentation from **pypi.python.org** or documentation from **readthedocs.io**.
