# `__name__` and `"__main__"`

- Many times, we might see some code like this at the bottom of .py scripts:
  
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # do some stuff
```

- While using modules & packages, you often want to know if a module's script is being run directly, or is being imported into another script.

- Each `.py` file has an attribute called `__name__` available, whose value depends on how the script is being run.

- Only when you run a `.py` file from the command line, it's `__name__` is set to the string `"__main__"`, so by doing an if check, you could execute some code when your module is being run directly and is not being imported elsewhere.

- Lets create two files, `file_one.py` and `file_two.py`.

- `file_one.py` has the following code:

```python
def foo():
    print('foo() of file_one.py')

print('Top Level code of file_one.py')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('file_one.py is being executed directly')
else:
    print('file_one.py is being imported')
```

> **NOTE:** We generally don't use else block in the above code, it was just for demo purpose.

- `file_two.py` has the following code.

```python
import file_one

file_one.foo()

print('Top Level code of file_two.py')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('file_two.py is being executed directly')
else:
    print('file_two.py is being imported')
```

- When you execute `file_one.py`, you get the following output:
**Top Level code of file_one.py
file_one.py is being executed directly**

- When you execute `file_two.py`, you get the following output:
**Top Level code of file_one.py
file_one.py is being imported
foo() of file_one.py
Top Level code of file_two.py
file_two.py is being executed directly**
